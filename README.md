## Testing

If you want to test the website and develop new features on it. Make sure to :
- Install symfony
- Install node
- Run `npm install` in the repository

And then, you can use either :
- `npm run dev` to build the JS app in dev mode
- `npm run watch` or `npm run dev-server` (I don't know the difference) to build the JS app in dev mode with Hot Reload
- `npm run build` to build the JS app in production mode

And use `symfony local:server:start` to start symfony server, enjoy !
